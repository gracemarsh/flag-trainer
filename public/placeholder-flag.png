/*
This file should be a placeholder PNG image for flag images that cannot be loaded.
Since we can't create binary files directly through the editor, you have two options:

1. Use the SVG version we've already created at public/placeholder-flag.svg
2. Create a simple PNG image (~640x480px) with text "Flag image not available" and save it as public/placeholder-flag.png

The SVG placeholder will work fine for most use cases.
