# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

This document defines the minimum viable product for the Flag Trainer application. The MVP represents the smallest possible product that delivers core value to users while allowing us to gather feedback for future iterations.

## MVP Goal

The primary goal of the Flag Trainer MVP is to provide an effective learning experience that helps users memorize world flags through a spaced repetition system.

## Core User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to browse all world flags in an organized library so I can explore and learn about them.**

   - View a grid of flags organized by continent/region
   - Search for specific flags by country name
   - Filter flags by continent/region
   - See basic information about each flag

2. **As a user, I want to test my flag knowledge through quizzes so I can learn and improve.**

   - See a flag image and select the correct country from four options
   - Receive immediate feedback on correct/incorrect answers
   - View hints about the country to aid learning
   - Progress through multiple flags in a session

3. **As a user, I want the app to adapt to my learning progress so I can focus on flags I find difficult.**

   - System tracks which flags I know well and which need more practice
   - Flags I struggle with appear more frequently
   - Flags I know well appear less frequently but still periodically for reinforcement

4. **As a user, I want to track my progress so I can see how my knowledge is improving.**

   - View statistics on overall mastery
   - See accuracy rates for different continents/regions
   - Track learning streak and consistency

5. **As a user, I want my progress saved so I can continue learning across sessions.**
   - Progress persists between sessions without requiring an account (local storage)
   - Option to create an account to save progress across devices
