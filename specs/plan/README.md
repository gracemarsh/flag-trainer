# Project Planning Specifications

This directory contains project planning documents for the Flag Trainer application. These specifications outline the development approach, timeline, and strategies for delivering the application.

## Directory Contents

- [MVP Definition](mvp.md) - Definition of the Minimum Viable Product
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) - Development phases and timeline
- [Implementation Strategy](implementation-strategy.md) - Development workflow and methodologies
- [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md) - Testing approach and best practices

## Purpose

The planning documentation serves as:

1. **Project Guide**: Provides a roadmap for development activities
2. **Scope Definition**: Clarifies what is in and out of scope for each phase
3. **Process Reference**: Defines how development, testing, and deployment should be conducted
4. **Timeline Reference**: Sets expectations for delivery schedules

## Relationship to Other Specifications

While these documents focus on project execution, they relate closely to:

- **Core Specifications**: What features will be built and when
- **Implementation Details**: How features will be implemented
- **Technology Stack**: What technologies will be used

## Using These Documents

These planning documents should be referenced:

1. At the start of each development phase
2. When prioritizing features or tasks
3. When onboarding new team members
4. During project status reviews

## Updating These Specifications

As the project evolves:

1. The roadmap should be reviewed monthly and updated as needed
2. The MVP definition should remain stable once agreed upon
3. Implementation and testing strategies may evolve as we learn
4. Changes should be tracked with dates in document revision history

This organization allows us to maintain clear planning documentation while keeping it separate from the technical specifications.
