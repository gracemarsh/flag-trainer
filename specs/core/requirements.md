# Flag Trainer: Requirements Specification

## Overview

Flag Trainer is a web application designed to help users learn all the flags of the world through interactive gameplay and educational content. The app uses spaced repetition learning techniques to optimize memory retention and provide an engaging experience for users of all ages.

## Architecture

The application uses a static data approach for flag information, with flag data stored directly in the application code rather than in a database. This architecture reduces database requests and improves performance, as flag data is loaded at build time and can be efficiently cached. The database is used exclusively for user session tracking and progress data.

## Target Audience

- Children and adults interested in geography and vexillology
- Students preparing for geography tests or competitions
- Travelers wanting to improve their global knowledge
- Anyone looking for a fun educational activity

## Core Features (MVP)

- **Learning by continent** allowing users to focus on flags from specific geographical regions
- **Quick learning sessions** with randomized flags for general practice
- **Spaced repetition algorithm** to optimize learning efficiency by prioritizing flags that users struggle with
- **Immediate visual feedback**: green background for correct answers, red for incorrect
- **Progression control**: users must press "Next" to proceed after answering
- **Educational hints** including geographical and cultural facts (population, continent, language)
