# Implementation Specifications

This directory contains detailed implementation specifications for Flag Trainer features. Each feature has its own subdirectory containing specifications at different stages of implementation.

## Directory Structure

```
implementation/
├── feature-name/              # Directory for each major feature
│   ├── 01-planning.md         # Initial planning document
│   ├── 02-design.md           # Detailed technical design
│   ├── 03-implementation.md   # Implementation guide and decisions
│   ├── 04-testing.md          # Testing approach and criteria
│   └── README.md              # Feature overview and current status
├── README.md                  # This file (implementation directory overview)
└── stateful-tracking.md       # Master document tracking implementation status
```

## Feature Status Template

Each feature's README.md should follow this template to maintain consistent tracking:

```markdown
# Feature Name: [Feature Name]

## Status

- [ ] Planning
- [ ] Design
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Maintenance

## Current State

Brief description of the current state of implementation.

## Next Steps

List of next steps to move the feature forward.

## Blockers

## Using This Directory

Use this directory to track the detailed implementation state of features as they progress through different stages of development. Each document should be updated as the feature progresses, with the README.md serving as a quick reference for the feature's current status.

For consistency with the rest of the documentation:

1. Keep technical specs here
2. Keep user-facing requirements in the `core/` directory
3. Keep UI designs in the `ui/` directory
4. Keep API specifications in the `api/` directory

This approach allows tracking the stateful implementation of each feature while maintaining consistency with the overall specification structure.
