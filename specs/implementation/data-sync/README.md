# Feature Name: Data Synchronization

## Status

- [x] Planning
- [x] Design
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Maintenance

## Current State

The data synchronization feature has been fully designed but not yet implemented. We have created specifications for how data will synchronize between local storage and server storage, including conflict resolution strategies and API endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the local storage management module
2. Create API endpoints for data synchronization
3. Implement the client-side synchronization logic
4. Implement server-side data merging logic
5. Add conflict resolution implementation

## Blockers

- User authentication system must be implemented before server synchronization can be fully tested
- Need to finalize the database schema for user progress data

## Implementation Details

### Local Storage Schema

```typescript
interface LocalStorageProgressData {
  version: number; // Schema version for future-proofing
  guestId: string; // UUID for anonymous users
  userId?: string; // Present if user has authenticated
  lastSyncedAt?: number; // Timestamp of last server sync
  flags: {
    [flagCode: string]: {
      correctCount: number;
      incorrectCount: number;
      lastSeen: number; // Timestamp
      nextReviewDate: number; // Timestamp
      easeFactor: number;
      interval: number; // In days
      needsSync: boolean; // Flag to indicate changes since last sync
    };
  };
}
```

### Synchronization Flow

1. Guest Mode → Local Storage
2. Account Creation → Data Migration to Server
3. Authenticated Mode → Bidirectional Sync

| Testing              | 3 days           | Week 4            | Not Started |

### Key Metrics for Success

1. Successful synchronization between devices
2. No data loss during synchronization
3. Performance: Sync operations complete in < 2 seconds
4. Offline capability maintains user experience
