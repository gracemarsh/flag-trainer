# Data Synchronization: Planning Document

## Feature Overview

The data synchronization feature enables Flag Trainer to seamlessly synchronize user progress data between local storage (for guest users) and server storage (for authenticated users). This feature is critical for providing a smooth transition from anonymous usage to authenticated accounts.

## Business Requirements

1. Users should be able to use the application and track progress without requiring an account
2. When a user creates an account, their existing progress should be preserved
3. Authenticated users should have their progress synchronized across multiple devices
4. The application should function offline with synchronization occurring when connectivity is restored

## Success Criteria

1. **Data Preservation**: No loss of user progress data during synchronization
2. **Seamless Transition**: Guest users can create accounts without interrupting their learning experience
3. **Multi-device Support**: Progress is consistent across different devices for the same user
4. **Offline Functionality**: Users can continue using the app without internet connection
5. **Performance**: Synchronization operations complete in under 2 seconds

## Architecture Approach

We will implement a hybrid data storage approach:

1. **Local-First Architecture**: All progress data is stored locally first, ensuring offline functionality
2. **Background Synchronization**: Data is synchronized to the server when:
   - A user authenticates
   - A user makes progress changes while authenticated
   - A user comes back online after being offline
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts arise between local and server data:
   - Use timestamp-based resolution at the individual flag level
   - Prefer the most recent data based on lastSeen timestamps
   - For counters (correctCount, incorrectCount), use the maximum value

## Technical Dependencies

1. **Local Storage API**: Browser's localStorage API for client-side data persistence
2. **Authentication System**: For user identification and session management
3. **API Endpoints**: For bidirectional data synchronization
4. **Database Schema**: For storing user progress data on the server
5. **Network Status Detection**: For detecting online/offline status

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                 | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data loss during synchronization     | High   | Medium     | Implement validation checks and fallback mechanisms       |
| Storage limitations in localStorage  | Medium | Low        | Implement data pruning for very old or less relevant data |
| Synchronization conflicts            | Medium | Medium     | Clear conflict resolution strategy with extensive testing |
| Poor performance with large datasets | Medium | Low        | Implement selective synchronization of only changed data  |
| Privacy concerns with guest data     | Medium | Low        | Clear user messaging about data storage and anonymization |

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Local Storage Foundation**

   - Implement local storage schema and CRUD operations
   - Add guest ID generation and management
   - Implement basic data validation

2. **Phase 2: API Layer**

   - Create REST endpoints for data synchronization
   - Implement authorization and validation
   - Add server-side conflict resolution logic

3. **Phase 3: Client Synchronization**

   - Implement online/offline detection
   - Add synchronization on authentication events
   - Implement background synchronization logic

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Test across multiple devices and browsers
   - Test conflict scenarios
   - Test edge cases like storage limitations
   - Performance testing and optimization
