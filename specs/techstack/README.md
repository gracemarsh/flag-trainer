# Technology Stack Specifications

This directory contains specifications for the technology stack used in the Flag Trainer application. These documents define the technical architecture, tools, libraries, and frameworks that will be used to build the application.

## Directory Contents

- [Overview](overview.md) - High-level overview of the complete technology stack
- [Frontend](frontend.md) - Frontend architecture and technologies
- [Backend](backend.md) - Backend architecture and technologies
- [Database](database.md) - Database design and technologies
- [Deployment](deployment.md) - Deployment strategy and infrastructure

## Purpose

The technology stack documentation serves as:

1. **Technical Reference**: Defines the specific technologies used for each part of the application
2. **Architectural Guide**: Explains how different components interact
3. **Onboarding Resource**: Helps new developers understand the technical landscape
4. **Decision Record**: Documents why specific technologies were chosen

## Relationship to Other Specifications

While these documents focus on the technology choices, they relate closely to:

- **Core Specifications**: The core functionality that the technology needs to support
- **API Specifications**: The APIs that will be built using these technologies
- **UI Specifications**: The user interfaces that will be implemented
- **Implementation Details**: How features will be implemented using these technologies

## Technology Selection Criteria

All technology choices have been evaluated based on:

1. **Suitability for requirements**: How well they meet the functional needs
2. **Performance characteristics**: How they perform for our specific use cases
3. **Developer experience**: How productive the team can be with these tools
4. **Maintainability**: Long-term supportability and sustainability
5. **Community and ecosystem**: Available resources, libraries, and support

## Updating These Specifications

When considering changes to the technology stack:

1. Propose the change with clear rationale
2. Evaluate the impact on existing components
3. Document the decision in the appropriate file
4. Update related implementation specifications

This organization allows us to maintain clear documentation of our technical decisions while keeping them separate from the feature specifications.
